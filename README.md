# -AI-driven-tunable-laser-source
The optimal wavelengths are calculated using an AI-driven tunable laser source,
 which dynamically adapts to environmental parameters. A theoretical expected wavelength is
 computed based on the water turbidity, and the simulation results from the AI-driven system
 are discussed in relation to real-life aquatic environments.
